    <h2>Just like Grandma's</h2>
    <p>French toast pancakes are a family favorite as we can never decide on French toast or pancakes! Great for any holiday breakfasts to keep everyone happy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste </li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 dash vanilla extract, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl; make a well in the center. Beat milk, egg, 2 tablespoons oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; pour into the well in the flour mixture and stir until batter is smooth.</li>
        <li>Drop about 1/4 cup batter per pancake onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>These will turn out darker than normal pancakes because of the ingredients for the French toast flavor. They need a slightly more careful eye.</p>
