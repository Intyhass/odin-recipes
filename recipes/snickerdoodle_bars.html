    <h2>Best for breakfast</h2>
    <p>These soft and fluffy bars are like a tasty cross between banana bread and snickerdoodle cookies. They also have the added bonus of requiring no eggs.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    ul{
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar </li>
        <li>1/2 cup mashed banana</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    }
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    ol{
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in banana and vanilla extract on low speed until thoroughly combined; mix in flour mixture just until dough comes together. Using lightly floured hands, press dough firmly and evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the 1 tablespoon white sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon; sprinkle cinnamon sugar evenly over the dough. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the dough in the center of the pan feels set when lightly touched with a finger, about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let bars cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Cut into 16 bars.
